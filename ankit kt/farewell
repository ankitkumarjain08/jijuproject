Dear Team,

As some of you may already know, today marks my last working day with BNY (Stradit).

Due to personal priorities, I have made the difficult decision to step away and pause this incredible journey. I want to take this moment to express my heartfelt gratitude to BNY for providing me with endless opportunities, remarkable experiences, and lifelong relationships.

I am truly thankful for the unwavering support and guidance I’ve received from each of you. The time I’ve spent here has been a profound learning experience, equipping me with knowledge and memories I will always cherish.

A special thanks to Santosh, Susanta, Gopi, Rajesh, Girish, Gaurav, Steve, Jinal, Pratyaksh, Nidhi, and the entire team—you all have been instrumental in making my journey here memorable. Kudos to each one of you for your contribution and collaboration!

To my mentors and colleagues, I wish you continued success and growth. BNY will always hold a special place in my heart.

Though I am leaving this chapter behind, I hope to stay in touch. Please feel free to reach out to me at AnkitKumarJain08@gmail.com or on my cell phone at +91-7620646828.

Wishing you all the very best for the future.

Signing off with gratitude,
Ankit Jain
